This library works with React Native components. However, library uses the [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html) built in NodeJS, so you have to install this as a library. You can install it using:
```
npm install -S events
```
Or with Yarn:
```
yarn add events
```

## Expo
Installing and using the events library does not seem to work with Expo, so currently this library does not work with Expo.
